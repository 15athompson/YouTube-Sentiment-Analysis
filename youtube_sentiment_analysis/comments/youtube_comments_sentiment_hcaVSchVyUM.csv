"the fine tuning gpt4o is the winner this week
oh, actually,maybe it has to compete with heygen's interactive avatars

Regarding the videos, how about someone create an AI program to fix the issues in the generated content.
post production AI - like audio cleanup, but video cleanup.
it would add some frames where needed, and remove some existing ones, without outcome being a seamless video that actually works.
Tell them to make that part of their video editor they are working on (fix the video first, then edit)","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.92, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.6249}",Positive,0.2583333333333333,89

"Thanks Igor for a very understandable discussion on fine-tuning. I've been studying into this topic on and off for a while now, and you explained it better than anyone. Now that I see what it is, I'm a bit disappointed. I expect an LLM to be good enough to access my clean, preprocessed Knowledge Base files and use its ""intelligence"" to answer user questions SO I DON'T HAVE TO CREATE A GLORIFIED FAQ. Fine-tuning, in my opinion, is kind of like owning a Ferrari but instead of driving it around town, we're pushing it around town.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.7263}",Positive,0.6055555555555556,100

I have a question (and possibly a tutorial idea) :
I have a 2018 MacBook Pro that can no longer support Apple‚Äôs updates so I‚Äôm still running Ventura and I‚Äôm not able to download the app for GPT 4o is there a safe-ish way to do this myself? 
Also would love Suno power user best practices. Also how do you take suno output (whether stems, compete result from a promt etc) and if needed convey the format for use on mobile (such as to create a custom ringtone and custom alert/notification tones) how we can apply these tones to Alexa or google home (if that's possible?) I HATE those sleeves tones with a burning passion! theyre a guaranteed way to instantly turn me into a bitch soon as I woke up if that's what I wake up from lol on the flip side; it has seemed to subconsciously train my body into a morning person who wakes up before the alarm goes off üòÇ yes I hate them that much","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.8837}",Positive,0.6425865800865801,189
