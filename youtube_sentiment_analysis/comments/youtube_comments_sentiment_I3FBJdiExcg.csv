"Hello there :)

I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future:

Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this.

And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience).

SO my suggestion is this:
Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. 

Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :)
