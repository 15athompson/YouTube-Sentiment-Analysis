1. increasing the number of participants
2. improving the set of questions
3. collecting which sites had the most activity for each participant on a given week.

"Before delving into machine learning I recommend aspiring data scientists hone data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills. Data familiarization and cleaning being foundational skills. There are smallish datasets that are appropriate for beginners and which can be visually scanned to confirm the findings reported. For example, the automobile fuel efficiency dataset available from UCI contains 'marked' missing values for some numeric data, data entry mistakes primarily in the make and/or model; not every make and model combination is present more than one year, and two fuel types are present. The data source makes available the original dataset as well as a subset still requiring further cleaning, along with a codebook describing the data and each variable. Many instructors tell you to begin by plotting the data but this approach has two problems: you do not know if there are any missing values or other incorrect values which can lead to plots which are erroneous or simply cannot be rendered; and you have not spent sufficient time understanding the raw data and the types of questions it might be able to answer.","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.0644}",Positive,0.36343406593406585,183

"I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and  occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts.

Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own.

We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit.

I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own.  Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this?

"Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried.","{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.8106}",Positive,0.35542875927491313,181
