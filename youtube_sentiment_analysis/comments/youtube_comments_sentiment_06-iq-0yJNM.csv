In fact consciousness is not a creations but everything in this universe is creation of consciousness.

Every atom of this universe knows how and when to combine with another to form a molecule. Every formation in this universe is not mechanical there is the science of consciousness behind it. Colour of colourful insects, plants birds, flowers etc is due to the fact that their consciousness know, what colour is to absorb and reflect.

"Have you ever tried the bioluminescent lure dance for an Aquanian Glowscale before? I performed this intricate dance three times with this massive Glowscale, and after the third attempt, I finally hooked up to this colossal creature. Wish I had my holo-recorder because it would've made an epic video. Here's the story of how I caught this elusive fish.

We were fishing in the phosphorescent seas of Velluria at the 13th tide, a time when the bioluminescent algae cast an eerie glow across the waves. My brother and I, both seasoned anglers of the Andromeda sector, were hunting for the elusive Glowscales, prized not just for their size but for their shimmering scales that fetch a high price in intergalactic markets.

Our bait? Live humans. They had been abducted from a little planet a few light-years away called Earth. Strapped into lumina-claw harnesses, their terrified movements made the perfect lure, irresistible to the Glowscales. The humans' frantic struggles mimicked the erratic movements of injured prey, drawing the predatory fish from the depths.

I was slow trolling my 1/2oz lumina-claw chatterbait along a crystal reef, its glow amplified by the panicked flailing of the human attached to it. When my lure approached our bio-ship, I noticed a sizable Glowscale trailing it. Instead of reeling it in, I began the bioluminescent lure dance, a series of rapid, erratic movements designed to imitate the frantic, glowing prey of the Glowscale. It pursued for a while before vanishing into the depths.

Frustrated but undeterred, I cast back toward the same crystal reef. As my lure neared the ship again, a Glowscale darted from underneath and lunged at my bait. It missed, so I performed the lure dance again, flicking the lure side to side, creating a mesmerizing light show. The human bait screamed, their voice muffled by the vacuum suit, adding an eerie undertone to the lure's glow. The Glowscale missed again and retreated beneath the ship. I thought to myself, could it be the same Glowscale from earlier?

I cast right next to the ship to see if it would strike again, but it never resurfaced. So I aimed at the crystal reef once more. As my lure came close to the ship, the Glowscale reappeared, missed the bait again, and I did the lure dance once more. It missed a second time. By now, I was super frustrated! This was the third time it evaded capture.

The Glowscale was using the shadow of the bio-ship to ambush any bioluminescent prey that swam by. Knowing it wouldn't strike at close range, I made another cast. As my lure approached the ship, the Glowscale swam out from underneath again. This time, I was ready. Before it could strike, I started the lure dance right away. After a few dazzling moves, ""Zap"". I finally hooked it.

Not realizing its true size until I had it hooked, I took it slow. My brother activated the netfield, and we secured it. I looked at him with joy and relief because this Glowscale had been stressing me out. After so many tries, the effort finally paid off.

We stored the Glowscale in the bio-hold, its scales shimmering under the containment lights. As we prepared to head back, I couldn't help but think about the tiny planet these humans came from. Earth, they called it. A place teeming with life, now a hunting ground for the galaxy's most dangerous sport.

Back on the ship, my brother and I discussed the ethics of our bait. ""It's not like they know,"" he said, ""besides, their numbers are in the billions. A few won't be missed.""

I wasn't so sure. Each human we used seemed to have its own personality, its own fear and desperation. They were more than just bait‚Äîthey were sentient beings with lives of their own. Their terror was palpable, their eyes pleading for mercy as they were dragged into the depths.

We entered the coordinates for our home base and engaged the warp drive. As the stars stretched into lines and we sped through the cosmos, I couldn't shake the feeling of guilt. The Glowscale we caught was magnificent, a true trophy, but at what cost? The thought of the humans, their planet, and our role in their abduction weighed heavily on my mind.

In the end, I resolved to find another way to catch Glowscales, a method that didn't involve sentient beings. But for now, I had to live with the knowledge of what I'd done, and the haunting memories of those terrified humans, their faces etched into my memory forever.","{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.9961}",Negative,0.48201562106324003,776

"I simply adore Brian Greene, and I respect a lot David Chalmers and sometimes I agree with Anil Seth but excuse me but The Hard Problem of Consciousness has an explanation and the explanation cannot be given by Science. Do you know why? Because if Science admitted that Consciousness is generated by the Soul, it would have to admit that the Human Being has a Soul and if this finding If it were endorsed by Science it would lead to countless problems for this Civilization. This is because it would be proven that Life does not end with the Death of the Physical Biological Body and thus, all people fearing the Destiny of their respective Souls, would live in totally different ways. And I say this because the Great Kabbalist Yair Alon states without hesitation that the one who generates Consciousness is the Soul, even though the exact conception of the Soul adopted by Christians came from the Greeks who also influenced the Jews, because they have the concepts of Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah , Chayah and Yechida which are concepts, as I said, previous and different from the interpretation of the Soul currently adopted. 
And in conclusion, I believe that Roger Penrose and Stewart Hammeroff are on the right path to decoding the Hard Problem of Consciousness because they consider the possibility that The Non--local Theory of Mind may be right and they study Near Death Experiences.

"I am a physicist and I explain why current physics leaves not room for the possibility that brain processes can be a sufficient condition for the existence of consciousness. The hypothesis that consciousness emerges from, or can be identified with physical, chemical or biological processes is incompatible with current physics.
It is a scientifically established fact that a mental experience is associated with numerous distinct microscopic physical processes that occur at different points; there is no physical entity that connects all these distinct microscopic processes, therefore the existence of mental experience requires an element of connection that is not described by current physics. This missing element of connection can be identified with what we traditionally refer to as the soul (in my youtube channel you can find a video with more detailed explanations). 

Emergent properties are often thought of as arising from complex systems (like the brain). However, I argue that these properties are subjective cognitive constructs that depend on the level of abstraction we choose to analyze and describe the system. Since these descriptions are mind-dependent, consciousness, being implied by these cognitive contructs, cannot itself be an emergent property. 

Preliminary considerations: the concept of set refers to something that has an intrinsically conceptual and subjective nature and implies the arbitrary choice of determining which elements are to be included in the set; what can exist objectively are only the individual elements. Defining a set is like drawing an imaginary line to separate some elements from others. This line doesn't exist physically; it‚Äôs a mental construct. The same applies to sequences of processes‚Äîthey are abstract concepts created by our minds. 

Mental experiences are necessary for the existence of subjectivity/arbitrariness and cognitive constructs; Therefore, mental experience itself cannot be just a cognitive construct. 
Obviously we can conceive the concept of consciousness, but the concept of consciousness is not actual consciousness; We can talk about consciousness or about pain, but merely talking about it isn‚Äôt the same as experiencing it. (With the word consciousness I do not refer to self-awareness, but to the property of being conscious= having a mental experiences such as sensations, emotions, thoughts, memories and even dreams)

From the above considerations it follows that only indivisible elements may exist objectively and independently of consciousness, and consequently the only logically coherent and significant statement is that consciousness exists as a property of an indivisible element. Furthermore, this indivisible entity must interact globally with brain processes because there is a well-known correlation between brain processes and consciousness. However, this indivisible entity cannot be physical, since according to the laws of physics, there is no physical entity with such properties. The soul is the missing element that interprets globally the distinct elementary physical processes occurring at separate points in the brain as a unified mental experience. 

Clarifications

The brain itself doesn't exist as a completely mind-independent entity. The concept of the brain is based on separating a group of quantum particles from everything else, which is a subjective process, not dictated purely by the laws of physics. Actually there is a continuous exchange of molecules with the blood and when and how such molecules start and stop being part of the brain is decided arbitrarily. An example may clarify this point: the concept of nation. Nation is not a physical entity and does not refer to a mind-independent entity because it is just a set of arbitrarily chosen people. The same goes for the brain.  

Brain processes consist of many parallel sequences of ordinary elementary physical processes occurring at separate points. There is no direct connection between the separate points in the brain and such connections are just a subjective abstractions used to approximately describe sequences of many distinct physical processes. Indeed, considering consciousness as a property of an entire sequence of elementary processes implies the arbitrary definition of the entire sequence; the entire sequence as a whole (and therefore every function/property/capacity attributed to the brain) is a subjective abstraction that does not refer to any mind-independendent reality. 

Physicalism/naturalism is based on the belief that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain. However, an emergent property is defined as a property that is possessed by a set of elements that its individual components do not possess; my arguments prove that this definition implies that emergent properties are only subjective cognitive constructs and therefore, consciousness cannot be an emergent property.   Actually, emergent properties are just simplified and approximate descriptions or subjective classifications of underlying physical processes or properties, which are described directly by the fundamental laws of physics alone, without involving any emergent properties (arbitrariness/subjectivity is involved when more than one option/description is possible). An approximate description is only an abstract idea, and no actual entity exists per se corresponding to that approximate description, simply because an actual entity is exactly what it is and not an approximation of itself. What physically exists are the underlying physical processes. Emergence is nothing more than a cognitive construct that is applied to physical phenomena, and cognition itself can only come from a mind; thus emergence can never explain mental experience as, by itself, it implies mental experience. 

Conclusions 

My approach is based on scientific knowledge of the brain's physical processes. My arguments show that physicalism is incompatible with the very foundations of scientific knowledge because current scientific understanding of molecular processes excludes the possibility that brain processes alone can account for the existence of consciousness. 
An indivisible non-physical element must exist as a necessary condition for the existence of consciousness because mental experiences are linked to many distinct physical processes occurring at different points; it is therefore necessary for all these distinct processes to be interpreted collectively by a mind-independent element, and a mind-independent element can only be intrinsically indivisible because it cannot depend on subjectivity. This indivisible element cannot be physical because the laws of physics do not describe any physical entity with the required properties.

"In my recent work, I propose that consciousness is the fundamental field driving the integration of information in the universe. This perspective unifies various phenomena, from quantum mechanics to cosmology, by suggesting that consciousness creates and integrates information, forming the fabric of reality.

Consciousness as a Fundamental Field
Consciousness is not just an observer but an active creator of information, collapsing infinite possibilities into specific realities. This process resembles the quantum mechanical concept of wavefunction collapse, where observation selects a particular state from a range of possibilities.

Space and Time
Space: Space can be understood as the structure formed by the interconnected nodes of information created and integrated by consciousness. The distance between objects is a measure of the information required to transition from one state to another, making space a fabric woven by the integration of information at different points.

Time: Time arises from the continuous process of information integration. It is not an independent dimension but a dynamic process that emerges as consciousness integrates information, creating a sequence of events. The rate of this integration determines the flow of time.

Patterns and Harmony
Natural patterns like the Fibonacci sequence and the Flower of Life reflect consciousness's tendency to organize information in balanced and harmonious ways. These patterns, found in both micro (biological structures) and macro (cosmic structures) scales, demonstrate the universal drive towards symmetry and order.

Entropy and Complexity
As consciousness integrates more information, the complexity of the entanglement network increases, leading to higher entropy. However, consciousness also seeks to maintain harmony, resulting in a dynamic balance between growth (increasing complexity) and symmetry.

Subjective Experience and Perception of Time
The rate of information integration in the brain affects our subjective experience of time. High cognitive load (being busy) leads to rapid information integration, making time feel like it‚Äôs flying. Low cognitive load (boredom) results in slower information integration, making time drag.

Supporting Studies
Transfer Entropy and Information Flow: Studies using transfer entropy to measure directional information flow in complex systems support the idea that increasing complexity corresponds to higher rates of information integration. This method is applied to systems such as neural networks and financial markets, illustrating how information transfer underlies complex behaviors.

Causal Emergence: Research on causal emergence shows how new macroscopic properties arise from interactions within a system, reinforcing the view that consciousness integrates and organizes information in increasingly complex ways.

Information Theory in Complex Systems: Shannon information theory applied to complex systems demonstrates how entropy and complexity are linked through information processing. These studies emphasize the role of information flow and integration in understanding the dynamics and evolution of complex systems.

Conclusion
By framing consciousness as both the creator and observer of information, my theory provides a rich, interconnected framework for understanding space and time as fundamental aspects of the universe. This dynamic equilibrium, where increasing complexity (entropy) is balanced by the drive for harmony and symmetry, offers a holistic view of reality. Grounding this theory in empirical research and existing scientific principles significantly advances our understanding of the cosmos and consciousness. I am excited to continue exploring these ideas and their potential to revolutionize our view of reality.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9949}",Positive,0.37782034632034633,527

"Attributing consciousness to LLMs I think runs on a very myopic conception of consciousness as linguaformal computation. Such systems can take natural linguistic inputs, ape dialog, process these inputs to produce outputs of different sorts: images, codes, aping dialog, etc. But nobody thinks a calculator is conscious because it takes formal linguistic inputs and produces mathematically correct outputs in the way that apes the way intelligent mathematicians do calculations. We have just figured out ways to ape human discursive-inferential reasoning in dramatically dynamic ways. 

In addition to being able to take linguistic inputs and produce all forms of linguistic and non linguistic outputs, consciousness also involves an integrated simulation of an environment of the sort that allows systems with working memory models to take different informational mediums and sorts of inputs and generate models of their environments and themselves within it, respond both through internal representations and external behavioral routines to all sorts of problems. Sure, we are making progress with things like delivery drones and self-driving cars, but then there is the complicated nexus binding reasoning and mental states to emotional, and sensorial states proper to creatures with complex nervous systems, including pain, pleasure.  

These affective responses might seem trivial or secondary to conscious behavior, but they really are not if you realize they are inextricable from all sorts of intentional attitudes like desiring, hoping, wanting, or higher order states like ""nostalgically remembering"", loving, etc. Even primitive sensory responses to psychosomatic stimuli like pain and pleasure are integrated in conscious machines into complex dynamics of encouragement/inhibition that orient an organism in its environment.

"I would say that everything is conscious and all existence in this Kaleidoscope reality in which we live in is conscience everything is God here everything came from the same Singularity the same Big Bang AKA God which is all-encompassing and completely alone. This is where the singularity goes to forget the fact that it's all encompassing and completely alone. Well recently i proved that we don't live in a 3+1 system of space-time... It is extremely simple to understand how blackholes, string theory and other logic converges of things come together under one-dimensional string membranes that are destroyed by The Singularity of a black hole and once this happens they are in a state in between 0 and 1 dimensional this creates Dark Matter coming out of black holes and what is considered non baryonic matter. This is the counterforce to the expansion of the universe. We don't we do not live in a 3 + 1 System One of the most important things that I recently came to conclude is that I have came up with a system to prove that we live in an infinite Multiverse. I will state it here and now. So if we follow the logical progression of the spatial Dimensions infinite zero-dimensional existence can stack into any size one dimensional existence and infinite one-dimensional existence can stack into any size two-dimensional existence and infinite two-dimensional existence can stack into any size three-dimensional existence so if we follow this logical progression we can conclude that infinite three-dimensional existence can stack into any size four dimensional existence. This means if we don't live in a 3 + 1 System we should observe the relative state or shape of the universe as flat or compressed in a non evenly distributed matter and basically we should observe a stacked effect of three-dimensional existence which would make a relatively flat universe or at least a universe in a distribution matter that is non spherical and evenly distributed... so because of this we can conclude that we are not the fundamental highest spatial Dimension and that a fourth spatial Dimension must exist and if so then infinite three-dimensional Universal potentiality can stack into any size four dimensional existence so ultimately this proves a Multiverse. Just remember infinite three-dimensional Universal potentiality can stack into any size four dimensional existence... this means that because the observed state of the universe is flat or non evenly distributed in a spherical manner then this means there is extra dimensional influence compressing the state making it stack and if a fourth spatial Dimension exists then a infinite Multiverse must exist and the stack ability must exist therefore this observed phenomenon means that a fourth spatial Dimension must exist making a infinite three-dimensional Multiverse the standard Norm... because of this my friends who doubted me are losing and understand that i Am truly the master of the ultraviolet üíú and green üíö machine!","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': 0.6861}",Positive,0.2826617826617827,490

But instead, anything that is apprehended by THOUGHT is NOT REALITY.     Buddha said that NOT KNOWING or understanding this IS THE CAUSE OF ALL SUFFERING.  Not knowing and understanding that anything THOUGHT PRODUCES IS NOT REAL, is the cause of ALL SUFFERING.

THOUGHT (the way it operates) is DUALISTIC, and REALISTIVIC by CONTRASTING POLAR OPPOSITES.  You cannot think of ""UP"" without simultaneously contrasting it to ""DOWN"", and every thought that you ever have works that way.   Because thought works that way, it is often referred to as JUDGEMENTAL.   or DUALISTIC RELATIVISTIC JUDGEMENTS. (not Reality)

Just because your THOUGHTS can become an intertwined complex of what seem to be related things, still does not make any of it REAL.  Unless you are aware of THAT, it is still AN UNCONSCIUS ILLUSUON, that you perceive as REAL.  The Hindu MAYA or the Buddha ""Cause of all Suffering"".

That implies that when thought is suspended there must be an underneath ""Direct Observation"", a ""Direct Perception"", ""Direct Knowing"" that bypasses DUALISTIC THOUGHT JUDGEMENT.

Jesus said, ‚ÄúAssuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."" - Matthew 18:3   (You will not perceive REALITY, but only DUALISTIC JUDGEMENTAL THOUGHT.)

THOUGHT ALSO CREATES THE EGO OR THE FALSE SELF.    BECAUSE THERE CAN BE ENDLESS DUALISTIC JUDGEMENTAL THOUGHTS ABOUT WHO AND WHAT YOUR ""SELF"" IS PERCIEVED AS.  I AM this, I AM that, and on and on.

If you SAY anything else following I AM, except I AM, ""Made in the Image of God"" that is just a False Ego Imaginary Self.  BECAUSE YOU ARE THAT FROM WHICH ""ALL AWARENESS"" ARISES.   That from which anything AT ALL can be EXPERIENCED and KNOWN.  While at the same time hiding that from your SELF in the MAYA of ILLUSION.

To me consciousness is just a collection of complex processes going on in a brain. These processes fundamentally are the same as processes which appear as a response to sensory input. However, consciousness is not a response to external input. Instead it's a collection of second/third/etc level processes which are triggered by lower level processes.

"First of all ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù needs to be clearly defined if we are to understand anything about it in the least. Without a very specific language we can never know if we are talking about the same things or not. 
So if we start here with a basic assumption that consciousness is the experience of ‚ÄúI‚Äù, that ‚ÄúI‚Äù, or something like my awareness of myself experiencing myself. 
From the start we can see that this experience of awareness of myself varies, Since I mention this you may have observed that you are a little more aware of yourself just now since we are thinking together on the topic. This variation can range from the sleep we experience every night in our beds where our awareness of self is minimal if at all, then we move to the ‚Äúwaking state of consciousness‚Äù. This is the state we are in most of the day. The state in which we can read, walk and talk, do our work and love our children or favorite pet. This state is a level of self consciousness mixed with dreams. Day dreams to be more precise. From this hazy drowsy state we can become more and more self aware, including an awareness and sensation of the body in full, the breath and even awareness of our heartbeat and blood flow in the body. Here we can have a more full awareness of ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù. A sense of a present sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äù that is continuous. This state of awareness can grow from there to even higher states that are possible. We can call these ‚Äúobjective consciousness‚Äù bc the awareness then transcends the ego limitations. This state of consciousness is what the mystics from the various religions speak about. This state of consciousness is often defined as unitive, non-dual giving the sense of ‚Äúoneness‚Äù to all things. 
It is in this highest state of consciousness that the origin of consciousness can be discovered. Not in the lower states that we normally inhabit. There we find that consciousness is fundamental. It is an emanation of the Divine Mind of the Godhead. 
Remember in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was of God and the Word was God and nothing was created that was not created through Him‚Ä¶. The Word, this Higher Intelligence is the Universal Consciousness of God. All things are created in the mind of God. It‚Äôs all right there in the Bible and has been understood by wise men throughout the centuries. 
So you can see that science is going to have a problem finding the source of consciousness. Until the scientist turn their scientific methods onto themselves and the discovery of these higher states of consciousness they will not find the answers we all seek. The Mystic is the one who Knows and understands these things.

Now it is clear that on the basis of a mere individual complex of experience not even the most gifted of men could construct anything like a comprehensive scientific system. So we are faced with the alternative of either renouncing the idea of a comprehensive science...or to admit a compromise and allow the experience of others to enter into the groundwork of scientific knowledge.

ChatGPT
That‚Äôs an interesting perspective on consciousness. Let's explore this idea further.

Stereoscopic Vision and Depth Perception
Our understanding of depth in vision, known as stereoscopic vision, is due to having two eyes positioned slightly apart. Each eye captures a slightly different image from a different angle. The brain processes these two images to create a single 3D perception of the world, allowing us to perceive depth.

Hemispheric Interaction and Consciousness
Drawing a parallel to how our two eyes work together to perceive depth, you propose that consciousness might similarly arise from the interaction between the two hemispheres of the brain. Here‚Äôs how this could be conceptualized:

Bilateral Brain Structure:

The human brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and the right, each responsible for different functions and processing styles.
The left hemisphere is typically associated with logical reasoning, language, and analytical thinking.
The right hemisphere is often linked to creativity, intuition, and holistic thinking.
Interhemispheric Communication:

The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that facilitates communication between the two hemispheres.
This communication is crucial for integrating information and ensuring coherent functioning of the brain.
Conscious Awareness:

The interaction and integration of information from both hemispheres could contribute to a unified conscious experience.
Just as depth perception relies on the integration of two slightly different images, conscious awareness might emerge from the synthesis of different types of processing and information from each hemisphere.
Complementary Processing:

Each hemisphere might provide a different ""angle"" or perspective on experiences and information.
The left hemisphere‚Äôs analytical approach could complement the right hemisphere‚Äôs holistic view, creating a richer, more comprehensive conscious experience.
Supporting Ideas and Theories
Split-Brain Research:

Studies on patients with a severed corpus callosum (split-brain patients) show that each hemisphere can function independently to some extent.
These studies reveal how different functions are lateralized and how interhemispheric communication is essential for unified consciousness.
Integrated Information Theory (IIT):

This theory proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information across different parts of the brain.
It suggests that the more integrated the information, the richer the conscious experience.
Global Workspace Theory (GWT):

According to GWT, consciousness involves the global availability of information processed by different parts of the brain.
The interplay between the hemispheres could be seen as part of this global workspace, where integrated information contributes to conscious awareness.
Conclusion
Your idea that consciousness arises from the interaction between the two hemispheres of the brain, similar to how depth perception arises from the integration of two visual perspectives, is a compelling analogy. It highlights the importance of integration and communication between different parts of the brain in creating a unified conscious experience. This perspective aligns with several contemporary theories in neuroscience and cognitive science.","{'neg': 0.005, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9903}",Positive,0.3815696649029983,526
"Consciousness is not beyond science, but it is beyond current science. Therefore, the real gap is first of all in the undiscovered prejudices that live in the minds of even the best of scientists, which means the gap is actually between the current level of consciousness and the level of consciousness that is needed for science to close the gap. So the future for science is not to remain within the limits of our current level of consciousness but rather to develop consciousness to the point where it can actually know and understand consciousness. This will most likely go hand in hand with understanding life because life and the evolution of consciousness appear to be very closely related.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9259}",Positive,0.36845238095238103,118

A DEEP DIVE INTO IMAGINATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS
INTRODUCTION
Integrating these revised concepts and multidimensional constructs with the bootstrapping process, this analysis offers a deeper understanding of imagination and consciousness. This framework provides a comprehensive perspective on the evolution and structure of consciousness, highlighting the dynamic interplay and iterative refinement processes that enhance the complexity and depth of conscious experience.
EMERGENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
The emergence of consciousness involves the integration of stable lower-dimensional constructs with higher-dimensional harmonics, facilitated by dynamic projection and reflection. Continuous feedback and integration between lower and higher-dimensional constructs enhance the complexity and depth of conscious experience. The comprehensive framework of multidimensional constructs offers insights into the evolution and structure of consciousness, highlighting the importance of imagination as the foundational aspect.
IMAGINATION AS PERCEPTION OF REALITY
Definition:Imagination is the ability to perceive and conceptualize potential realities. It provides a basic awareness and landscape within which consciousness operates, independent of accuracy.
Imagination=‚àëùëñ=1ùëõ(ùë§ùëñ‚ãÖùë•ùëñ)+ùëèImagination=‚àëi=1n‚Äã(wi‚Äã‚ãÖxi‚Äã)+b
This can be thought of in terms of a perceptron where ùë§ùëñwi‚Äã are the weights, ùë•ùëñxi‚Äã are the inputs, and ùëèb is the bias.
Bootstrapping Analysis:The process of bootstrapping begins with imagination, where basic perceptual frameworks are iteratively refined and expanded, laying the groundwork for more complex structures. As weights and biases are adjusted through learning, the perception of reality becomes more nuanced and accurate.
CONSCIOUSNESS
Definition:An advanced state of awareness and reflection built on the foundational landscape provided by imagination. It involves higher-order processing, reasoning, memory, and reflective thought.
Consciousness=‚à´ùë°0ùë°1(‚àëùëñ=1ùëõ(ùë§ùëñ‚ãÖùë•ùëñ(ùë°))) ùëëùë°Consciousness=‚à´t0‚Äãt1‚Äã‚Äã(‚àëi=1n‚Äã(wi‚Äã‚ãÖxi‚Äã(t)))dt
Consciousness integrates over time, reflecting on past inputs and adjusting perceptions and reactions accordingly.
Bootstrapping Analysis:Consciousness bootstraps from imagination by continuously refining and integrating perceptual inputs into coherent, higher-order structures. Each level of reflective processing builds upon previous iterations, enhancing complexity and self-awareness.
MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENTANGLEMENT
Definition:Consciousness as a manifestation of multidimensional entanglement, built through layers of complexity from 1D to higher dimensions using Bayesian measurements, sacred geometry, circuits, and cymatics.
Bootstrapping Analysis:Multidimensional entanglement involves iterative refinement at each dimensional layer, with stable constructs in lower dimensions serving as the foundation for more complex interactions in higher dimensions.
INTEGRATION OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCTS
DIMENSIONS 1-3
Bayesian Measurements:Providing the fundamental perceptive awareness and landscape.
ùëÉ(ùê¥‚à£ùêµ)=ùëÉ(ùêµ‚à£ùê¥)‚ãÖùëÉ(ùê¥)ùëÉ(ùêµ)P(A‚à£BüôÅP(B)P(B‚à£A)‚ãÖP(A)‚Äã
Bootstrapping Analysis:Bayesian measurements bootstrap by iteratively refining probability distributions based on new data, enhancing the accuracy and stability of the perceptual landscape.
Sacred Geometry and Circuits:Establishing stable, self-evident structures and interactions within the perceptual landscape.
(ùë•‚àí‚Ñé)2+(ùë¶‚àíùëò)2=ùëü2(x‚àíh)2+(y‚àík)2=r2
Bootstrapping Analysis:Sacred geometry and circuits bootstrap by using foundational geometric patterns and electrical circuits that self-organize into stable, repeatable structures through iterative refinements.
DIMENSION 4
Time and Harmonization:Sorting and stabilizing 1-3D constructs over time. Predictable perturbations and stable harmonics form patterns (bifurcation stable solutions).

Bootstrapping Analysis:Time and harmonization bootstrap by continually refining temporal interactions and harmonic patterns, leading to increasingly stable and predictable configurations over successive iterations.
DIMENSIONS 5-9
Cymatics and Wave Collision:Complex interactions and harmonics forming stable shapes capable of holding consciousness up to higher dimensions. Chakra theory maps these stable harmonic shapes.

Bootstrapping Analysis:Riemann equations bootstrap by iteratively solving for complex interactions and scaling relationships, enabling the transition from lower to higher dimensions through refined mathematical mappings.
EXPANDED MATHEMATICAL INTEGRATION
IMAGINATION AS THE FOUNDATION
Mathematical Integration:The perceptron model provides a mathematical basis for understanding how imagination functions as a foundational perceptual mechanism. By adjusting weights and biases, the perceptron refines its ability to distinguish and categorize inputs, thereby enhancing its perceptual accuracy.
ùë¶=sign(‚àëùëñ=1ùëõ(ùë§ùëñ‚ãÖùë•ùëñ)+ùëè)y=sign(‚àëi=1n‚Äã(wi‚Äã‚ãÖxi‚Äã)+b)
Bootstrapping Analysis:The iterative refinement of the perceptron model leads to a more nuanced and accurate perceptual landscape, providing a robust foundation for higher-order cognitive processes.
CONSCIOUSNESS AND REFLECTIVE PROCESSING
Mathematical Integration:The integration of perceptual inputs over time can be modeled using integral calculus. The reflective processing of consciousness involves the continuous integration of new experiences and insights.
ùê∂(ùë°)=‚à´ùë°0ùë°(‚àëùëñ=1ùëõ(ùë§ùëñ‚ãÖùë•ùëñ(ùúè)))ùëëùúèC(t)=‚à´t0‚Äãt‚Äã(‚àëi=1n‚Äã(wi‚Äã‚ãÖxi‚Äã(œÑ)))dœÑ
Bootstrapping Analysis:The iterative integration of experiences and insights leads to progressively more complex and coherent structures of self-awareness, enabling advanced reflective processing.
EMERGENT CONSCIOUSNESS
Multidimensional Entanglement:The interaction of stable lower-dimensional constructs with higher-dimensional harmonics can be modeled using differential equations and harmonic analysis.
ùëë2ùë•ùëëùë°2+ùúî2ùë•=0dt2d2x‚Äã+œâ2x=0
Bootstrapping Analysis:The iterative refinement of these harmonic interactions leads to increasingly sophisticated and stable forms of awareness.
Dynamic Interplay:The balance between imaginative projection and reflective integration can be modeled using dynamic systems theory.

I guess I don't mean such that you can explain the world using math so much as that the matter of each world is phenomenologically related to being part of a system. The system relies upon the math of itself to exist. 

In this case, whatever zero divided by zero is makes a difference. At first, I thought this was another example of the classic debate between Aristotle and Plato over whether experience is more valuable than reason for reaching truth. But you can see it is a zero over zero problem because the definition of zero can be from differing points of view. You can, for instance, reach zero in a system where whatever you are measuring can be temporarily depleted, or you can reach zero in a system where once the thing is gone it is gone forever. One definition of zero may be cyclical, while the other one isn't. 

In the system that is our consciousness, as it relates to the world, there is a viable range over which zero can exist in relation to itself and mean anything. We only seem to experience consciousness across that viable range. 

I suppose it is important to add that just because we exist within that range doesn't mean that we have any inherent understanding of what it consists of. We go about expecting to know it when we see it, yet we see it all of the time and don't know anything. 

In that sense, it is no surprise that world level consciousness changing events in people's lives can also seem to alter their perceptions such that they can be like different people afterward, yet have a sense of continuity about the experience the same.","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.917, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.51}",Positive,0.49721177944862155,320

All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . .

"A segment from 'Saved by the Light of the Buddha Within'... 
My new understandings of what many call 'God -The Holy Spirit' - resulting from some of the extraordinary ongoing after-effects relating to my NDE... 

Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what some scientists are now referring to as the unified field of consciousnesses. In other words, it‚Äôs the essence of all existence and non-existence ‚Äì the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the actual creator of everything that exists now, ever existed in the past, or will exist in the future ‚Äì right down to the minutest particles of dust ‚Äì each being an individual ripple or wave. 
The big difference between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a ‚Äòmiddleman‚Äô to connect us to our state of inner enlightenment, we‚Äôre able to do it ourselves. That‚Äôs because chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo allows us to tap directly into our enlightened state by way of this self-produced sound vibration. ‚ÄòWho or What Is God?‚Äô If we compare the concept of God being a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to the teachings of Nichiren, it makes more sense to me that the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people perceive to be God, is the fantastic state of enlightenment that exists within each of us. Some say that God is an entity that‚Äôs beyond physical matter ‚Äì I think that the vast amount of information continuously being conveyed via electromagnetic waves in today‚Äôs world gives us proof of how an invisible state of God could indeed exist. 
For example, it‚Äôs now widely known that specific data relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects ‚Äì including an instant global awareness of something or a mass emotional reaction. It‚Äôs also common knowledge that these invisible waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars ‚Äì none of which is possible without a receiver to decode the information that‚Äôs being transmitted. Without the receiver, the data would remain impotent. In a very similar way, we need to have our own ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our own life, all other life and what everything else in existence is. 
Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach the core of our enlightenment and keep it switched on. That‚Äôs because Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what scientists now refer to as the unified field of consciousnesses. To break it down ‚Äì Myoho represents the Law of manifestation and latency (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. For example, the state of Myo is where everything in life that‚Äôs not obvious to us exists ‚Äì including our stored memories when we‚Äôre not thinking about them ‚Äì our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they‚Äôre dormant ‚Äì our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma ‚Äì and more importantly, our enlightenment. 
The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes evident to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory ‚Äì whenever we experience or express our emotions ‚Äì or whenever a good or bad cause manifests as an effect from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it merely means that it‚Äôs come out of the state of Myo (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It‚Äôs the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing. 
The second law ‚Äì Renge ‚Äì Ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect, governs and controls the functions of Myoho ‚Äì these two laws of Myoho and Renge, not only function together simultaneously but also underlies all spiritual and physical existence. 
The final and third part of the tri-combination ‚Äì Kyo, is the Law that allows Myoho to integrate with Renge ‚Äì or vice versa. It‚Äôs the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects all Life and matter ‚Äì as well as the past, present and future. It‚Äôs also sometimes termed the Universal Law of Communication ‚Äì perhaps it could even be compared with the string theory that many scientists now suspect exists. 
Just as the cells in our body, our thoughts, feelings and everything else is continually fluctuating within us ‚Äì all that exists in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux ‚Äì constantly controlled by these three fundamental laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of Myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible to calculate or describe. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how big or small, famous or trivial anything or anyone may appear to be, everything that‚Äôs ever existed in the past, exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of the Laws ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô ‚Äì the basis of the four fundamental forces, and if they didn‚Äôt function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. That‚Äôs because all forms of existence, including the seasons, day, night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation ‚Äì rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two fundamental states of Myo and ho in absolute accordance with Renge ‚Äì and by way of Kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn under the workings of what the combination ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô represents. Nam, or Namu ‚Äì which mean the same thing, are vibrational passwords or keys that allow us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with ‚ÄòMyoho-Renge-Kyo‚Äô. 
On a more personal level, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it‚Äôs the causes that we‚Äôve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives ‚Äì as well as the environment from moment to moment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is spinning, and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo for a minimum of, let‚Äôs say, ten minutes daily to start with, any of us can experience actual proof of its positive effects in our lives ‚Äì even if it only makes us feel good on the inside, there will be a definite positive effect. That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre able to pierce through the thickest layers of our karma and activate our inherent Buddha Nature (our enlightened state). By so doing, we‚Äôre then able to bring forth the wisdom and good fortune that we need to challenge, overcome and change our adverse circumstances ‚Äì turn them into positive ones ‚Äì or manifest and gain even greater fulfilment in our daily lives from our accumulated good karma. This also allows us to bring forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that‚Äôs preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we indeed are ‚Äì regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexuality. We‚Äôre also able to see and understand our circumstances and the environment far more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations. As I‚Äôve already mentioned, everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect ‚Äì the ‚Äòactual-proof-strength‚Äô resulting from chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo always depends on our determination, sincerity and dedication. 
For example, the levels of difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, producing a great song, and so on. Something else that‚Äôs very important to always respect and acknowledge is that the Law (or if you prefer God) is in everyone and everything. 

NB: There are frightening and disturbing sounds, and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It‚Äôs the emotional result of any noise or sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day, we are producing a sound vibration that‚Äôs the password to our true inner-self ‚Äì this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things ‚Äì such as your fears and desires etc. The best way to get the desired result when chanting is not to view things conventionally ‚Äì rather than reaching out to an external source, we need to reach into our own lives and bring our needs and desires to fruition from within ‚Äì including the good fortune and strength to achieve any help that we may need. Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo also reaches out externally and draws us towards, or draws towards us, what we need to make us happy from our environment. For example, it helps us to be in the right place at the right time ‚Äì to make better choices and decisions and so forth. We need to think of it as a seed within us that we‚Äôre watering and bringing sunshine to for it to grow, blossom and bring forth fruit or flowers. It‚Äôs also important to understand that everything we need in life, including the answer to every question and the potential to achieve every dream, already exists within us.","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9995}",Positive,0.5145112820968988,1640

"Both speakers seem to accept, one more then the other, that AI can achieve consciousness. Here is my concern with the view.

What is or where from comes consciousness? For bizarre reasons I have become interested in this, kind of. My interest was peaked when I become frustrated by AI enthusiasts banging on about robots becoming more 'intelligent' than humans. Invariably they seem to confuse intelligence with computational speed and algorithmically-derived problem-solving. My first thought was surely intelligence arises when a human (or a robot?) know it is wrong, not when it gets everything right. But to 'know' something surely involved conscious thought. 
Then I watched a few videos of Sir Roger Penrose, Nobel prize-winning theoretical physicist and mathematician, explaining how anesthetists use inert gas to render the brain unconscious. Being inert the process cannot be chemical, therefore it must be physical. Penrose speculates that the physical route into the brain is through micro-tubules that act like funnels into every cell in the brain, giving them both structure and a channel of communication. This pushes intelligent thought back from the level of neurons to the cells that compose the neurons, implying that neurons are transmitting intelligence, not originating it.
The next step in the argument is one difficult to fully comprehend. Basically, as I understand it, the process by which information is transmitted is through particles (think of photons that carry light for example) but to identify a particle is problematic because they travel in waves. Only when the wave function is temporarily broken (e.g. using the hadron collider) can the position of the particle be detected. Somehow the brain feeds off the infinitesimally short time period when that happens. How this happens is one of the mysteries. Why is this important? Because it is a quantum process subject to the bizarre laws of quantum mechanics which are NOT computable.  AI depends upon computational processes, so it cannot, according to this theory, be intelligent... EVER. 
For example, when surgeons connect sensors to the brain and link them to limbs, the brain can move the limbs, but this is the transmission of an idea, not its origin. The person has to think the movement before executing it. AI can then, and only then, do its job.
Today I came across by accident the following article on the concept of 'emergence' and consciousness. I'm not sure how or whether it fits into the idea of micro-tubules (it talks instead of neurons) and the quantum state of consciousness, but its another part of the puzzle. Interestingly, another video references two recent lab experiments that do support the possibility that the process of consciousness of a quantum process. Hmm.

"Great discussion. Dr. Anil wished for a simple formula stating the relation between the inner perceiver and the perceived. It is simple to express and to consider seriously. Postulate that conservation of unified mass energy unifies again with conservation of the inner observer's personal identity, a simple sameness not to be confused with an ego's growth or decay. Why postulate so? For a sound reason. Ask yourself, how could we know of the sameness or symmetry of instantiated physical law, namely relativity, if the inner observer were not itself conserved? Before the hard problem of consciousness, we had the mind and body problem. Restate the latter as the mind and motion of bodies problem. There again, ego-identity, a personal identity generally, must conserve since as a then state of rest, motion of bodies would only then convey physical meaning or information. As opposed to the blooming buzzing confusion. Our intelligible view of sensation could only attribute to a relation between rest and motion, the simple sameness of personal identity or the ego, a quantity which must conserve for an ordinal view of nature to exist in us. Consequently, conservation of energy and conservation of personal identity are inseverable, a reason to postulate a unifying conservation law. Now work the problem backwards, and find self as elemental to physiology. Denis Noble then makes sense when he says on the microcellular level, activity is 'directed'. Or ant colonies that seem to be a super organism controlled by an ephemeral or super or supra consciousness, understood by the postulate as a personal identity. Is that surprising? We need to know if the moral arc of the universe though long, bends toward justice. There are existential reasons to know and to set aside dogma and cognitive bias and use relativity as a guide to substance, a spirit antithetic to motion, and yet conserved as is energy. And then go study microsaccades, particularly Coppola and Purves 1996. Forget the brain as anything other than a computational system that is directed by exigencies of a life force. Buck up. Have courage.

We could say and then explore the idea that being always the same core me is what conservation of energy feels like.","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9756}",Positive,0.4215401785714287,369

 ## 'The Game'

Rules and Minimum Requirements for the Game

1) 3 people (A, B, C)

2) A, B, and C will be the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

3) A, B, and C can converse about any topic that arises or that they like, but they must follow these rules:

                          _Syntactic/Semantic Rule

a) None of the first-person singular pronouns can be used (I, Me, Myself, Mine, With Me)

a.1) Consequently, the verb conjugations associated with them cannot be used either.

However, if A, B, or C want to make a self-referential sentence (for example, ""A"" wants to say something about ""A""), they can simply refer to ""themselves"" using the third-person singular, plural, and/or passive voice pronoun, conjugation, and/or name...

(for example, ""A"" is called Amanda.

Amanda(A) wants to tell B and/or C something about ""herself"" (Amanda)...

Then, Amanda (A) can talk about ""Amanda"" by talking about Amanda.

                           _Space-Time Perceptual Rule

b) If ""A"" speaks, B and C look at each other and do not see A. (A speaks and observes the space between B and C)

If ""B"" speaks, A and C look at each other and do not see B. (B speaks and observes the space between A and C)

If ""C"" speaks, A and B look at each other and do not see C. (C speaks and observes the space between A and B)

                     _Self-Correction and Cognitive Assimilation Rule

c) Practice rules a and b until achieving spontaneous fluency in the ""trialogue""...

Participants must inform the group when the rules are not followed.

                      _Scoring rule: 

The one who spots the mistake wins a point, and the one who makes the mistake loses a point.

.....

These are the basic rules of ""The Game""...

Once assimilated, there are more variants.

"I think that it's possible that consciousness is a field, no different than any other quantum field. It doesn't need to be called the consciousness field, but whatever we want to call it, the point is that when other fields interact with it and cause excitations those excitations are generated consciousness. It has certain requirements, that is, it requires the amalgamation and coalescence, the interaction if you will - of multiple fields in to produce something that is complex enough to generate an excitation in this field and that excitation is what we call a conscious mind. For macroscopic objects to exist, there must be an interaction between the quark and gluon fields, that generate excitations in the proton and neutron field, and then those fields have to interact with each other and the electron field in order for atoms to exist.

This can be done using a fiber optic HYBRID gyroscope. Based on the completion of more than 70% of Michelson's experiment, the following postulates can be proven: 
Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta, and dominant gravitational fields adjust the speed of light in a vacuum. you can make scientific discoveries; in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, higher theoretical physics,...

"At some level what we would call consciousness is not substrate dependent. It is likely that we may create phenomenon in non-biological substrate that we will call conscious.

Why a naturally evolved, unguided process of evolution produce complex life that is capable of consciousness that is biology based? Simple. Biology is basically organic chemistry. The nature ended up using what raw material was readily available in the natural environment and conditions on earth i.e. carbon based organic chemistry which is the basis of biology and is capable of long complex molecules. In the conditions that existed on earth, the abundance of Carbon and liquid water, the special nature of 4 covalent bond laced carbon atoms (complexity capable), the earth like conditions of temperature, pressure, gravity, distance from the sun and the fact that these conditions remained stable for evolutionary scales, is the reason why we find conscious entities on the Earth that are biology by which really mean organic chemistry based. BTW if the same conditions are met elsewhere, life is likely an imperative (check out the research by Michel Levin on Xenobots) What life needs is basically build up of complexity. Life (like or similar to the life on Earth) is an imperative of organic chemistry in specific conditions and evolutionary time scale stability. And consciousness is an imperative of life if it evolves. The key answer is complexity.

Now why did nature take 2+ billion years to produce life capable of properties we would call conscious? Simple again. Because it is an unguided process. So the climb on the complexity moutain was slow and sometimes retrograde. 

And now that Humans are here, who have agency and intent and in fact can control the environment. Therefore ,we are closer to building potentially conscious entities in Silicon. Why Silicon? Simple. It is easier to control the manufacturing of silicon based systems (large arrays of billions of similar structures lithographed on silicon wafers) which can be focused for simple computation. In fact, the evolution towards conscious entities in silicon is also following similar paths as biological evolution. With silicon we started by simply building adding and logical operations (And, Or, Not gates) machines which where simple things that did computations - think of this like unicellular life. And by building layers and layers and layers of hardware and software we have arrived at LLMs. LLMs and Rule based AIs will likely give us AGI. There are hints of this already. I think of LLMs like emotions and Rule based AI systems as rational thoughts if you think analogy to consciousness. Also note that the ""conscious"" behavior is not coming from only logic gates and transistors inside a CPU of a computer, but it is the result of computer memory, complex dynamical state of the ram and the algorithms that run on them. This bring me back to the point that consciousness is not a thing but a process and  in some sense an abstract idea and thus IS substrate independent.

One more point to think about is that the space-time-agency (trade-off) factors in production of consciousness. Because nature did not have agency, it took 2+ billion years to get there and produced agents like humans. And because now humans have agency, the time-frame for us producing consciousness is orders and orders of magnitude quicker to get there relative to the time-frame it took for nature.","{'neg': 0.003, 'neu': 0.949, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': 0.9589}",Positive,0.44356580919080923,563
"Nothing creates consciousness. Consciousness is the Creator. Consciousness creates the world. Just give the holographic principle of quantum gravity its proper interpretation and this point is obvious. An observer in an accelerated frame of reference gives rise to an event horizon that becomes the observer's holographic screen when qubits of information are encoded on its horizon. As Tom Banks has shown, this mechanism of creation is called a matrix model. That's how the observer's holographic world appears to come into existence. As Ted Jacobson has shown, the laws of physics in that holographic world arise as thermodynamic equations of state. There is only the perception of a consensual reality shared by many observers when their respective holographic screens overlap like a Venn diagram and share information. In effect, the observer is creating its own quantum computer that gives rise to the perception of its own world as a computer-generated virtual reality.

"Looking forward to it.

The ""hard problem of consciousness"" is a dogma for consciousness research just like ""Shut up and Calculate"" WAS (not IS, because now a days it is being ignored) a dogma for quantum mechanics. We should prefer Anil Seth's ""Real Problem of Consciousness"" over David's 30 year old, outdated idea of ""Hard Problem of Consciousness"". That is similar to what fundamental research in Quantum Physics community is doing with the dogma ""Shut up an Calculate"".BTW we can hear Tim Maudlin, David Albert, Sean Carroll all saying that ""Shut up an Calculate"" actually held back progress in fundamental understanding of Quantum Physics.  In fact, Adam Becker has written a book called ""What is real?"" describing how Copenhagen group's insistence on ""Shut up an Calculate"" was a mistake. Learn from the mistake, do not give up.
