"Over the past couple of years, I feel like I‚Äôve been an outlier because of my support for Claude over ChatGPT. However, with the release of Sonnet, my preference has been completely justified. With Sonnet, Claude‚Äôs ability to code has gotten to the next level. The only reason I use other models for coding is to compare their code against the code Claude generates, and most of the time what the other models generate are works of pure fiction.

I‚Äôm working on a solution for identity management, and quite frequently I use Claude for either information about technologies, or to generate code snippets to give me a push in the right direction.

Instead of ‚Äútaking over‚Äù my coding, Claude frees me to be more creative: I can use the code he generates as a starting point, which allows me to focus on architecture.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.945}",Positive,0.48736263736263735,151
