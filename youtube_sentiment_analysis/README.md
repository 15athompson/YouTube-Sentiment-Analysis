YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis
This project is a Python script that performs sentiment analysis on the top-level comments of a given YouTube video using Google's YouTube API and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)'s VADER sentiment analyzer. The resulting sentiments are then visualized through graphs and tables.

Getting Started
To run the script, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from here if needed.
Install required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt or manually install them with pip:
google-api-python-client==2.53.0
nltk==3.7
pandas==1.4.3
matplotlib==3.5.2
seaborn==0.11.2
		
Instructions
Clone the repository onto your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youTube-Comments-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd youTube-Comments-Sentiment-Analysis
Sign up for an API key at Google Developer Console (details here). Replace the placeholder value in the code (DEVELOPER_KEY) with your actual API key.
Run the script using your desired IDE or terminal:
python main.py
The following output will be generated after processing:

A table displaying the original comments along with their calculated compound sentiment scores.
A bar plot showing the sentiment distribution among positive, negative, and neutral categories.
Average sentiment score across all analyzed comments.
Two files created:
youtube_comments_sentiment.csv containing the commented dataframe including sentiment scores and labels.
sentiment_distribution.png presenting the graphical representation of the sentiment distribution.

 I'll implement these improvements to enhance the functionality and usability of the script. I'll focus on adding user input for video ID selection, implementing multi-threading for faster processing, and expanding the analysis to compare multiple videos. I'll also refine the UI design with more informative output and add some additional NLP features.
Improved YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis ScriptClick to open code
I've made the following improvements to the script:

User Input Functionality: The script now prompts the user to enter one or more YouTube video IDs, allowing for analysis of multiple videos.
Multi-threading: I've implemented multi-threading using ThreadPoolExecutor to speed up the sentiment analysis process for large datasets.
Multiple Video Comparison: The script can now analyze multiple videos and provide a comparison of their sentiment and subjectivity scores.
Enhanced NLP Features: I've added subjectivity analysis using TextBlob and included word count as an additional metric.
Improved UI and Output: The script now provides more detailed output for each video, including average sentiment score, subjectivity score, and word count. It also generates separate CSV files and visualization charts for each video.
Video Comparison Visualization: For multiple videos, the script creates a scatter plot comparing average sentiment and subjectivity scores across videos.

To use this improved script, you'll need to install a few additional libraries:
Copypip install tqdm textblob
The script now offers a more comprehensive analysis of YouTube comments, with improved performance and the ability to compare multiple videos. It provides both textual and visual output, making it easier to interpret the results.
Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or make any further modifications? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.ATimplement improvements EditCertainly, I'll implement some additional improvements to further enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the script. I'll focus on error handling, data visualization enhancements, and adding some more advanced NLP features.
Further Improved YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis ScriptClick to open code
I've implemented the following additional improvements:

Command-line Arguments: The script now uses argparse to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to specify video IDs directly when running the script.
Enhanced Error Handling: Added try-except blocks to handle potential errors when fetching comments from the YouTube API.
Word Cloud Generation: The script now generates a word cloud for each video, providing a visual representation of the most frequent words in the comments.
Top Words Analysis: Added a function to analyze and visualize the top N most frequent words in the comments.
Improved Data Preprocessing: Implemented tokenization and stopword removal to improve the quality of word frequency analysis.
More Detailed Output: The script now provides more comprehensive output, including top words and their frequencies.
Additional Visualizations: Added word cloud and top words chart for each video analyzed.

To use this improved script, you'll need to install an additional library:
Copypip install wordcloud
You can now run the script from the command line like this:
Copypython script_name.py video_id1 video_id2 video_id3
These improvements provide a more comprehensive analysis of YouTube comments, with enhanced visualizations and more detailed insights into the content of the comments. The script is now more robust, user-friendly, and provides a richer set of analytics for each video analyzed.

 I'll implement further improvements to enhance the script's functionality, performance, and user experience. I'll focus on adding more advanced NLP features, improving the visualization capabilities, and making the script more configurable.
Advanced YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis ScriptClick to open code
I've implemented the following additional improvements:

Advanced Text Preprocessing: Added lemmatization to reduce words to their base form, improving the quality of word frequency analysis and topic modeling.
Topic Modeling: Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, providing insights into the main themes discussed in the comments.
Configurable Comment Limit: Added a command-line argument to specify the maximum number of comments to analyze per video.
Improved Logging: Implemented proper logging throughout the script for better tracking of the analysis process and any potential issues.
Structured Output: Results are now saved in a structured JSON format for each video, making it easier to use the results in other applications or analyses.
Organized Output Directory: Created a separate output directory for each video, containing all relevant files (visualizations and results).
Performance Tracking: Added execution time tracking to monitor the script's performance.
Enhanced Error Handling: Improved error handling for API requests and other potential issues.

To use this improved script, you'll need to install additional libraries:
Copypip install scikit-learn
You can now run the script from the command line like this:
Copypython script_name.py video_id1 video_id2 video_id3 --max_comments 1000
These improvements provide an even more comprehensive analysis of YouTube comments, with advanced NLP features like topic modeling, better organization of results, and improved performance monitoring. The script is now more robust, configurable, and provides richer insights into the content and sentiment of the comments.

the key improvements made to the project:

Asynchronous Processing: We've introduced asyncio and aiohttp to handle API requests asynchronously. This significantly improves performance when analyzing multiple videos.
Environment Variables: The YouTube API key is now loaded from an environment variable using python-dotenv, enhancing security and configurability.
Type Hinting: We've added type hints throughout the code, improving readability and allowing for better IDE support and static type checking.
Error Handling: We've improved error handling and logging throughout the script, making it more robust and easier to debug.
Code Structure: The code has been reorganized for better readability and maintainability.
Performance Optimization: The get_video_comments function now uses aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests, which should improve performance when fetching comments.
Modularization: Some functions have been broken down into smaller, more focused functions, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
Constants: API-related constants have been moved to the top of the file for easier configuration.
Documentation: Docstrings and comments have been added to improve code understanding.
Dependency Management: A requirements.txt file should be created to list all necessary dependencies.
Code Style: The code now follows PEP 8 style guidelines more closely.

To further improve this project, you could consider:

Adding unit tests to ensure code reliability.
Implementing a caching mechanism to store API results and reduce API calls.
Creating a config file for various settings (e.g., number of topics, top words to display).
Adding more advanced NLP techniques like named entity recognition or sentiment analysis using more sophisticated models.
Implementing a simple web interface to display results interactively.
Adding support for analyzing YouTube playlists or channels, not just individual videos.
