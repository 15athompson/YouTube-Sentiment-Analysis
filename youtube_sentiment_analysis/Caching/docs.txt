Implementing a caching mechanism is an excellent way to reduce API calls and improve the performance of your application. We'll use a simple file-based caching system to store the API results. This approach will save the comments for each video ID in a separate JSON file, and we'll check this cache before making an API call.
Let's modify the main script to include this caching mechanism:
YouTube Comment Analysis Script with CachingClick to open code
Now, let me explain the key changes and additions we've made to implement the caching mechanism:

New imports: We've added imports for hashlib (for creating unique filenames), aiofiles (for asynchronous file operations), and some datetime modules for managing cache expiration.
Cache configuration: We've defined CACHE_DIR and CACHE_EXPIRY_DAYS constants to configure where cache files are stored and how long they're considered valid.
get_cached_comments function: This asynchronous function tries to read cached comments for a given video ID. It also checks if the cache has expired based on the CACHE_EXPIRY_DAYS setting.
save_comments_to_cache function: This asynchronous function saves fetched comments to the cache, along with the current date for expiration checking.
Modified get_video_comments function: We've updated this function to first check the cache using get_cached_comments. If cached comments are available and not expired, it uses those. Otherwise, it fetches comments from the API as before and then saves them to the cache using save_comments_to_cache.
Asynchronous file operations: We use aiofiles for asynchronous file reading and writing, which is consistent with the asynchronous nature of our main script.

This caching mechanism provides several benefits:

Reduced API calls: For frequently analyzed videos, we'll only need to make API calls once every CACHE_EXPIRY_DAYS.
Faster subsequent runs: After the initial API call, subsequent analyses of the same video will be much faster as they'll use cached data.
Reduced API quota usage: By caching results, we reduce the risk of exceeding YouTube API quotas during development or frequent use.

To further improve this caching mechanism, you could consider:

Implementing a more sophisticated cache invalidation strategy (e.g., based on video update time).
Using a database for caching instead of files, which could be more efficient for large-scale use.
Adding cache compression to reduce disk usage.
Implementing a way to manually invalidate the cache for a specific video.
