Project: YouTube Sentiment Analysis
Description:
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of comments on YouTube videos to understand the audience's reactions and opinions. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and YouTube API, the project fetches comments, preprocesses the text, and performs sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and various visualizations.

Key Components:
YouTube API Integration: Utilizes the YouTube Data API to fetch comments from specified videos.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the text using NLTK, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Sentiment Analysis: Employs VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and TextBlob for sentiment scoring and analysis.
Visualization: Generates sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, and top word frequency plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Topic Modeling: Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify and present key topics discussed in the comments.
Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming: Enhances performance by fetching and processing comments concurrently using aiohttp and ThreadPoolExecutor.
Technical Details:
Libraries Used: NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Aiohttp, Google API Client, Tqdm, JSON, Argparse, and Logging.
Environment Management: Utilizes dotenv to manage API keys and other environment variables securely.
Data Handling: Processes comments into structured DataFrames for analysis and visualization.
Workflow:
Setup:

Load environment variables and set up logging.
Initialize YouTube API client.
Download necessary NLTK data for text processing.
Fetch Comments:

Asynchronously fetch comments for each video up to a specified maximum.
Handle pagination and error checking during the fetch process.
Preprocess Text:

Tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize the text.
Convert text to lowercase and filter out non-alphanumeric characters.
Analyze Sentiment:

Calculate sentiment scores using VADER and TextBlob.
Classify comments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Extract additional metrics like subjectivity and word count.
Generate Visualizations:

Create and save sentiment distribution bar charts.
Generate and save word clouds.
Plot and save top word frequencies.
Topic Modeling:

Perform topic modeling using TF-IDF and LDA.
Extract and present key topics from the comments.
Save Results:

Save sentiment analysis results and visualizations in a structured directory.
Generate a JSON file summarizing key metrics and findings.
Comparison:

Compare sentiment and subjectivity across multiple videos.
Generate and save a comparison scatter plot.
Achievements:
Successfully fetched and analyzed comments from multiple YouTube videos.
Generated insightful visualizations and reports on audience sentiment.
Identified key topics and trends within the comments.
Enhanced performance through concurrent processing and asynchronous programming.
