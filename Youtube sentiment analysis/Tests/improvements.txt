Changes:

Error handling: Improved error handling by catching specific exceptions and logging error messages.
Code organization: Reorganized the code into separate functions for each task, making it easier to read and maintain.
Type hints: Added type hints for function parameters and return types.
Docstrings: Added docstrings to functions to provide a brief description of what each function does.
Logging: Improved logging by using a consistent format and adding more informative log messages.
Performance: Improved performance by using a ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize the sentiment analysis task.
Visualization: Improved visualization by using seaborn's barplot function to create a more informative sentiment distribution chart.
Topic modeling: Improved topic modeling by using a more robust LatentDirichletAllocation algorithm and visualizing the topics using a word cloud.
