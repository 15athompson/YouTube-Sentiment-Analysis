"Looked at several analyst roles in business such as those related to sales in Insurance companies and retail, they dont seem to require python at all or that much.

Why the focus on Python and R when these roles are likely to be those used extensively not by analysts but senior level Data Scientists? Is this the standard in Tech or Big Tech FAANG roles?

"Hi Ken Jee,

Hope you're doing well! Would appreciate your thoughts when you have a free moment.

I am in the US, NYC area, looking to dabble in Data Analysis specifically for applying to Financial Planning 
Specifically for visualizing data and using Data, Factor Analysis similar to PortfolioVisualizer when looking at stock market return data series, with the longer-term goal of eventually simulating systematic stock market factor-investing strategies. 

I already have a strong understanding of the Finance Theory behind these quant strategies, however, I don't have knowledge of the Ddta side. I'd like to acquire that knowledge in order to apply it in my own projects and in mimicking others'.

Can you provide some direction?
My current assumption is that R would possibly be more suited and in demand than Python for my specific industry. Unfortunately I'm not sure what specific topics I would want to investigate in order to gradually expand what I can analyze within stock market data.

So, I am returning to college this year. I am going back to computer science. I am studying Java because of that.
And because I was struggling to learn python, my godness! I try every possible way, then I turn out to python official documentation. I achieve a more cleary glimpse of what is python, but nothing too much practical. I found a guy, corey schaffer, he is really didatic. 
My goal, for this month, is start a small data science project for a local market here where I live. I already have SQL, MySQL, AWS basics and a solid background in maths and stathistics. I think i can do it. If don't, the lesson will be learned. You know.

1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project.
